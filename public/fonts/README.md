Place font files for the project here.

Recommended:
- Use .woff2 (preferred) or .woff.
- Name them clearly, e.g. `metcon-scaled-regular.woff2`.

After adding, register them via `@font-face` in your CSS (or a global stylesheet) and reference the font-family names in the design system tokens/components.
